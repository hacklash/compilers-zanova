  * Test Grader - grade each student's tests against known faulty compilers
  * Test Runner - run each student's code against our tests, and other students' tests
  * Test Database - record student's valid test cases and how many other students' compilers fail to pass the test
* Per Language
  * Specification
  * Interpreter - the reference implementation (Includes a parser and IR data structures)
