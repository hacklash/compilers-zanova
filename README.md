================

The Infrastructure for a new compilers class, building a compiler for a functional language.

* Test Format Spec
* Submission Grader
  * Test Validator - accept no tests that fail against the reference implementation
  * Test Grader - grade each student's tests against known faulty compilers
  * Test Runner - run each student's code against our tests, and other students' tests
  * Test Database - record student's valid test cases and how many other students' compilers fail to pass each test
* Per Language
  * Specification
  * Interpreter - the reference implementation (Includes a parser and IR data structures)
  * Example Compiler
  * Test Cases
  * Faulty Compilers
* Languages
  * Single Byte Numbers
  * + Arithmetic and Logic
  * + Multiplication and Division
  * + Comparison Operators
  * + If0
  * + Functions for Explicit Continuations
  * Top Level Functions
  * Automatic CPSing to ^
  * Vector function and Malloc
  * List Functions
  * Closures
  * ...
